I am a 4th year PhD Candidate at [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/) working with [Jarad Niemi](http://www.jarad.me/). Currently, I am a Research Assistant in the RNA-seq group and a consultant for the [Agricultural Experiment Station consulting group](http://stat.iastate.edu/agriculture-experiment-station-consulting-group).  [(Resume)](../eric_mittman_resume.pdf) 

### Research
In my research, I use computationally intensive [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) samping methods to fit Bayesian models. My favorite black box to use is [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/). My area of application is gene expression data analysis using flexible, nonparametric hierarchical models.

### Personal

Jessa and I are proud parents of three children, ages 1, 6 and 9. We met while Sophomores at [Luther College](https://www.luther.edu/) in beautiful [Decorah, Iowa](http://www.visitdecorah.com/). Jessa stays busy supporting our families day to day operations and directing our kids educational activities. I have two younger brothers: Scott is working on a master's in math at [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu/) and  Michael is Vice President at [Cellencor](http://www.cellencor.com/) in Ankeny, IA where they do interesting things with microwaves. My father, Tom, coaches [Iowa City High's girls cross-country and track teams](http://www.cityhighruns.com/). Last, my mother, Laurie, is a research scientist at [Bishop Lab](http://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/labs/bishop/) at the University of Iowa where she studies cells related to immune responses.

### Hobbies
- Playing with my children:
9 y.o. enjoys board games, Pokemon, soccer and electronic toys, 6 y.o. loves imaginitive play, which often features me as her horse and the 1 y.o. likes my silly face and building (knocking down) block towers.
  
- Running:
I mostly run for fitness, but occasionally train to compete. In 2013, I ran my PR in the Minneapolis Marathon (2:49).

- Cooking:
Cooking is fun. Usually, I do basic weeknight stuff like pasta or roasted chicken and vegtables. During warm months I like to get the grill going on the weekend. Having worked previously at [Pagliai's Pizza](http://www.pagliaisic.com/) and [New Pioneer Food Co-op](https://www.newpi.coop/) in Iowa City, I've learned how to make good [pie](https://emittman.github.io/images/pizza.jpg).

- Making music:
These days, I like to play out of old piano books while hanging out at home. Previously I had the pleasure of being a member of the [City High](https://cityhighmusic.jimdo.com/orchestra/) and [Luther College](https://www.luther.edu/music/symphony-orchestra/) symphonic orchestras, playing the string bass.
