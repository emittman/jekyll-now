I am a 4th year PhD Candidate at Iowa State University. In my time here I have been an instructor for an introductory statistics course, a research assistant in the RNA-seq group and a consultant for the Agricultural Experiment Station consulting group which also provides support to the college of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

### Research
In my research, I use computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo samping methods to fit Bayesian hierarchical models. My area of application is gene expression data analysis using flexible nonparametric models. 

#### Hobbies
I enjoy playing with my children, jogging, cooking and baking and strumming the guitar. In the future, I look forward to family vacations, having my son beat me in basketball and getting the band back together.
