I am a 4th year PhD Candidate at [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/). In my time here I have been an instructor for an introductory statistics course, a research assistant in the RNA-seq group and a consultant for the [Agricultural Experiment Station consulting group](http://stat.iastate.edu/agriculture-experiment-station-consulting-group). [(Resume)](../rsm.pdf)

### Research
In my research, I use computationally intensive [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) samping methods to fit Bayesian hierarchical models. My area of application is gene expression data analysis using flexible, nonparametric models. 

### Personal
I am a proud husband to my wife, Jessa, and father of our three children, ages 1, 6 and 9. We met while Sophomores at [Luther College](https://www.luther.edu/) in beautiful [Decorah, Iowa](http://www.visitdecorah.com/). I have two younger brothers: Scott is a graduate student at [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu/) and  Michael is Vice President at [Cellencor](http://www.cellencor.com/) in Ankeny, IA.

### Hobbies
I enjoy playing with my children (ages 1, 6 and 9), running, playing basketball, cooking, and making music.
