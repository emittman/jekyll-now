This passage stuck out for me:

>Being empirical about teaching
is hard. Lack of incentives aside, we
feel like we move from case study to
case study as college instructors and
that our teaching is a multifaceted
craft difficult to decompose into
discrete malleable elements. But
even those of us who work with
smaller classes can take systematic
measurements of what our students
knew before and after each
class and we can roll out innovations
more carefully to assess their
effectiveness. Even if variation is
high enough and sample sizes low
enough that not much could be
concluded, we suspect that the very
acts of measurement, sampling, and
experimentation would ultimately
be a time-efficient way of improving
our classes.
