We took the unorthodox route of traveling across the country by train
for the holiday. We took the
[Empire Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Builder) from
Portland to St. Paul, 36 hours, with two overnights.

We managed to leave our car parked at home by taking advantage of the
downtown Hillsboro 
MAX stop. Here's what the rest of us looked like at this point.
