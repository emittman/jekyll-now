This site is based on Barry Clark's freely available ["Jekyll Now"](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) tutorial. As a computer geek, I like the separation of content and structure. I haven't figured out how all the templating works, but it seems pretty intuitive and there is good documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/). I am not very interested in CSS, so it is a plus that I like the look.
