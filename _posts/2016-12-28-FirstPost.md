This site is based on Barry Clark's freely available Jekyll Now theme [source code](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). As someone with only rudimentary knowledge of web development, I am pleased with the results and the ease of set-up. Using GitHub pages makes the workflow extremely simple, you just write Markdown then add, commit, push changes and hit refresh.
